# Use Firefox with proxy

Firefox gives you the option of using the system proxy settings or manually specifying the proxy settings. To change proxy behavior, 
go to `Preferences > Advanced > Network > Settings...`.

You can install the [Toogle Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-proxy-51740/?src=search) add-on to easily and quickly
switch between two proxy options (e.g. system proxy and manual).
